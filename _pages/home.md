  <h1>Hi, I'm Avra.</h1>

  <p>
    I'm a Growth Engineer at <a href="https://riff.ai" target="_blank">Riff</a> (formerly Databutton) 
    with a PhD in Biophysics. I build and ship systems that connect product, growth, and data.
  </p>

  <h2>Now</h2>
  <p>
    I build and run the growth stack at Riff—shipping experiments, analytics pipelines, 
    CMS integrations, event tracking infrastructure, and tooling that powers data-driven 
    product and marketing decisions. Fast iterations, measurable outcomes.
  </p>

  <h2>Before</h2>
  <p>
    Joined Databutton in 2023 as an early team member. 
    Worked across the stack—from developer tooling and technical support to growth engineering. 
    Helped scale the platform during rapid growth from a 7-person startup.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before Riff, I spent five years doing research in biophysics—studying photosynthesis and 
    energy transfer in cyanobacteria. Earned my PhD (summa cum laude) from 
    <a href="https://vu.nl" target="_blank">Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam</a> and 
    <a href="https://www.szbk.u-szeged.hu/en/" target="_blank">Biological Research Centre, Szeged</a>. 
    Built kinetic models in MATLAB and Python, ran time-resolved spectroscopy experiments, 
    published 10+ peer-reviewed papers.
