  <h1>Hi, I'm Avra.</h1>

  <p>
    For the past 5 years, I worked as a PhD researcher studying the primary processes of photosynthesis and the light-harvesting mechanisms in cyanobacteria. I used various scientific tools and systems modeling techniques to understand these processes. You can read more about my research work and see my publications <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bTzfXH0AAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1" target="_blank">here</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    During my research, I authored 10 peer-reviewed publications and developed a strong interest in scientific coding. I started by building simple GUIs and then moved on to experimenting with the latest AI technologies and Large Language Models (LLMs) to create web applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    Seeing the potential of AI in technology, I decided to pivot my career to the tech industry. I joined <a href="https://databutton.com" target="_blank">Databutton</a>, an exciting AI startup, where we are creating the first autonomous AI app builder that lets anyone build full-stack web apps through conversation (aka prompting).
    In my current job, I help builders to create full-stack web apps and also educate users on how to use the latest AI stacks and LLMs in their products.
