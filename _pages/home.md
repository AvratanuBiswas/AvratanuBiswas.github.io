  <h1>Hi, I'm Avra.</h1>

 <p>
    I’m a technical generalist and Growth Engineer at 
    <a href="https://riff.ai" target="_blank">Riff</a> (formerly Databutton). 
    I build and ship systems that connect product, data, and growth.
  </p>

  <p>
    I work across experimentation, analytics, and operations -
    running fast, data-informed iterations with a bias for speed, clarity, and measurable outcomes. 
    My focus is on designing scalable workflows and growth systems that help teams move faster and make better decisions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before Riff, I spent five years as a PhD researcher studying 
    photosynthesis and energy transfer in cyanobacteria, earning my 
    PhD in Biophysics (summa cum laude). 
    My work focused on picosecond-scale excitation energy transfer and systems modeling 
    using spectroscopy and simulation tools. You can read my thesis 
    <a href="https://doktori.bibl.u-szeged.hu/id/eprint/12304/" target="_blank">here</a>.
