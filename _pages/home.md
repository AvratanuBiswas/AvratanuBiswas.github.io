  <h1>Hi, I'm Avra.</h1>

  <p>
    For the past 5 years, I worked as a PhD researcher studying the primary processes of photosynthesis and the light-harvesting mechanisms in cyanobacteria. I used various scientific tools and systems modeling techniques to understand these processes. During my research, I authored 10 peer-reviewed publications, and one of the significant findings was on <i><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fpls.2023.1300532/full" target="_blank">probing the direct excitation energy transfer from phycobilisomes to the photosystem I in vivo</a></i>. You can read more about my research work and see my publications <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bTzfXH0AAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1" target="_blank">here</a>.
  </p>
<p>
  While working on my PhD, I developed a strong interest in scientific coding and technology. Initially, I started by building simple GUIs to aid my research, which gradually led me to explore more complex applications using the latest AI technologies and Large Language Models (LLMs). I also worked on a few open-source projects, which we eventually managed to publish in form of a peer-reviewed article <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2022.990846/full" target="_blank">(link to the article)</a> and as a book chapter <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780443186387000013" target="_blank">(link to the book chapter)</a>.
</p>

  <p>
    Seeing the potential of AI and fast advancements of LLMs, I decided to pivot my career to the tech industry. I joined <a href="https://databutton.com" target="_blank">Databutton</a>, an exciting AI startup, where we are creating the first autonomous AI app builder that lets anyone build full-stack web apps through conversation (aka prompting).
    In my current job, I help builders to create full-stack web apps and also educate users on how to use the latest AI stacks and LLMs in their products.
