  <h1>Hi, I'm Avra.</h1>

  <p>
    I'm a Growth Engineer at <a href="https://riff.ai" target="_blank">Riff</a> (formerly Databutton), 
    building and running the growth stack with a focus on fast iterations, clear metrics, and measurable outcomes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Joined Databutton in 2023 as an early team member when it was a 7-person startup. 
    I worked across support, debugging, product feedback, and growth to help scale the platform and onboard our first builders. 
    We've since raised our Series A, and I now focus fully on building and running our growth stack.
  </p>

  <p>
    I come from academia with a PhD in Biophysics from 
    <a href="https://vu.nl" target="_blank">Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam</a> and 
    <a href="https://www.szbk.u-szeged.hu/en/" target="_blank">Biological Research Centre, Szeged</a>, 
    where I researched photosynthesis and energy transfer in cyanobacteria using time-resolved spectroscopy and kinetic modeling. 
    Published 10+ peer-reviewed papers. 
    <a href="https://doktori.bibl.u-szeged.hu/id/eprint/12304/" target="_blank">Read my thesis</a>.
